The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is an index published annually by [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/en) that ranks countries based on perceived levels of public sector corruption [^1]. It measures perceptions rather than actual corruption levels, which are inherently difficult to quantify directly.

The CPI scores countries on a scale from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean) using data from expert assessments and opinion surveys. It aggregates data from multiple independent [sources](https://images.transparencycdn.org/images/CPI2024_SourceDescription.pdf) including the African Development Bank.

The index helps highlight corruption as a global issue, creates accountability for governments, and serves as a benchmark for anti-corruption progress. Countries with higher scores typically demonstrate stronger rule of law and government institutions.

Across Africa, CPI scores vary significantly by region. According to the [2024 CPI report](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024), the continent's average [^2] was 32, below the global average of 43, and has shown little change since 2012. African Island nations perform best with an average score of 46, followed by Southern Africa (38), and Western Africa (36). The lowest scoring regions are Central Africa (25), Eastern Africa (27), and Northern Africa (28).

At the country level, the contrast is even more striking. Seychelles (72), Cape Verde (62), Botswana (57), and Rwanda (57) demonstrate relatively strong anti-corruption measures, while South Sudan (8), Somalia (9), Equatorial Guinea (13), Eritrea (13), and Libya (13) face the most severe corruption challenges.

At its worst, corruption doesn't just steal money; it steals our time, our dreams, and our future - robbing both current and future generations of what should be rightfully theirs. To live in a corrupt country is to mourn the life you could've had.
